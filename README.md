## Installation

### Using Docker

To install the example application you need to [install Docker Compose package](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
When Docker Compose is installed, clone this repository and build a Docker image by using the `build` directive:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:uploadcare/pyuploadcare-example.git
$ docker-compose build
```

This command will build an image for the application.

When the image is ready â€” up the containers with the following command.

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Then, apply migrations:

```console
$ docker-compose run --rm uploadcare ./manage.py migrate
```

Now, the application must be available in your web-browser, on `http://localhost:8000`

### Without docker

First of all, clone this repository:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:uploadcare/pyuploadcare-example.git
```

Make sure Python and Poetry are installed on your system. Fire command prompt and run command:

```console
$ python -V
Python 3.9.6
$ poetry --version
Poetry version 1.1.9
```

If Python or Poetry are not installed, check out following links with instructions, how to install those:
* [Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Then install dependencies:

```console
$ poetry install
```

After dependencies are installed, apply database migrations:

```console
$ poetry run python app/manage.py migrate
```

Now, you can run the server:

```console
$ poetry run python app/manage.py runserver
```

and see the application available in your web-browser, on `http://localhost:8000`
